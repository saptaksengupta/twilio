Dear Sir,

I regret to inform you that I am resigning from my position here immediately as a Junior Web developer for personal reasons and due to some family circumstances.
Also this sifting process is getting a bit uncomfortable for me because of my health problem.My last day is today. I know this is unexpected, but am happy to assist you in the replacement process to help alleviate the transition.

I cannot thank you enough for the opportunities this company has provided me. Working here for the last eight months has been incredibly instrumental in my personal growth, 
and I will never forget the colleagues and friends I have made here.

I will miss both the customers and the company alike very much.


If there is anything I can do to help make this transition easier, please let me know. I do not intend to inconvenience you with this news, 
and I hope you will accept my most sincere apologies in making September 20th my final day here. If necessary, I can be available for phone and email inquiries from home on a limited basis for the weeks following my departure date.

Thank you so much for your understanding in this matter. I have loved my job and I will look back on my time here with wonderful memories.

Sincerely,
